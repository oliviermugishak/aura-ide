# ðŸŒŒ Aura â€” The Next Generation IDE

## About Aura IDE

---

**Aura** is a futuristic code editor and IDE concept, inspired by the sleek design and dynamic experience of Opera GX (for those who know ðŸ˜‰).

While building a full-fledged IDE is a massive undertaking, Aura starts with a simple but powerful goal: **to create an extensible code editor** with an immersive UI, sound effects, smooth transitions, and customization that brings joy to developers.

This project is in its early stages, but the vision is clear â€” reimagining what it feels like to write code.

## A Message from the Creator

---

Hi! I'm **Olivier**, a high school student and hobbyist software developer. I love solving problems and turning creative ideas into real projects.

I donâ€™t have a big team (yet), and Iâ€™m not sure how this project will grow. But if youâ€™ve stumbled across Aura and share the same passion, Iâ€™d love to have you involved.

Whether it's through code, design, ideas, or feedback â€” your contribution could help shape something awesome.

## âœ¨ Thanks for Reading

Stay tuned for updates â€” and maybe, the future of code editing.
